Escaping a single metacharacter with a backslash works in all regular expression flavors. Many flavors also
support the \Q...\E escape sequence. All the characters between the \Q and the \E are interpreted as literal
characters. E.g. «\Q*\d+*\E» matches the literal text „*\d+*”

3. Match C:\temp
^[a-zA-Z]:\\temp

 Use «\t» to match a tab character (ASCII 0x09), «\r» for carriage return (0x0D) and «\n» for line feed (0x0A)

With a "character class", also called “character set”, you can tell the regex engine to match only one out of
several characters. Simply place the characters you want to match between square brackets. 

4. Find a word, even if it is misspelled, such as «sep[ae]r[ae]te» or «li[cs]en[cs]e».
5. Find an identifier in a programming language with «[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*».
6. Find a C-style hexadecimal number with «0[xX][A-Fa-f0-9]+»

Typing a caret after the opening square bracket will negate the character class. The result is that the character
class will match any character that is not in the character class - q[^u]
If you want the regex to match the q, and only the q, in both
strings, you need to use negative lookahead: «q(?!u)». But we will get to that later (?<=q)u

Note that the only special characters or metacharacters inside a character class are the closing bracket (]), the
backslash (\), the caret (^) and the hyphen (-). The usual metacharacters are normal characters inside a
character class, and do not need to be escaped by a backslash. To include a backslash as a character without any special meaning inside a character class, you have to escape
it with another backslash. «[\\x]» matches a backslash or an x
 The closing bracket (]), the caret (^) and the
hyphen (-) can be included by escaping them with a backslash, or by placing them in a position where they do
not take on their special meaning. I recommend the latter method, since it improves readability. To include a
caret, place it anywhere except right after the opening bracket. «[x^]» matches an x or a caret. You can put
the closing bracket right after the opening bracket, or the negating caret. «[]x]» matches a closing bracket or
an x. «[^]x]» matches any character that is not a closing bracket or an x
«[\Q[-]\E]» matches „[”, „-” or „]”
\s\d vs [\s\d]    - ex 1 + 2 = 3

«[\da-fA-F]» matches a hexadecimal digit

[^\d\s] vs [\D\S]

7. If you want to repeat the matched character, rather than the class, you will need to use backreferences. «([0-9])\1+» will match „222” but not “837”

Regex Matching Modes: /i, /s, /m, /x

Possesive vs Greedy vs Lazy
19. "[^"]*+"
"abc"
"abc
The main practical benefit of possessive quantifiers is to speed up your regular expression. In particular,
possessive quantifiers allow your regex to fail faster
E.g. «".*"» will match „"abc"” in “"abc"x”, but «".*+"» will not match this string at all
20. ".*" vs ".*+"

. Lookahead and Lookbehind Zero-Width Assertions
(?!) - negative lookahead
(?=) - positive lookahead
(?<=) - positive lookbehind
(?<!) - negative lookbehind

Positive lookahead works just the same. «q(?=u)» matches a q that is followed by a u, without making the u
part of the match
25. «q(?=u)i» to “quit”

Note that the lookahead itself does not create a
backreference. So it is not included in the count towards numbering the backreferences. If you want to store
the match of the regex inside a backreference, you have to put capturing parentheses around the regex inside
the lookahead, like this: «(?=(regex))»

Given the string foobarbarfoo
bar(?=bar)     finds the 1st bar ("bar" which has "bar" after it)
bar(?!bar)     finds the 2nd bar ("bar" which does not have "bar" after it)
(?<=foo)bar    finds the 1st bar ("bar" which has "foo" before it)
(?<!foo)bar    finds the 2nd bar ("bar" which does not have "foo" before it)

Therefore, many regex flavors, including those used by Perl and Python, only allow fixed-length strings. You
can use any regex of which the length of the match can be predetermined

28. Let’s say we want to find a word that is six letters long and contains the three subsequent letters “cat”.
((\b\w{2}cat\w{1}\b)|(\b\w{3}cat\b)...)
cat\w{3}|\wcat\w{2}|\w{2}cat\w|\w{3}cat

RIGHT - (?=\b\w{6}\b)\w*cat\w*

29. So, what would you use to find any word between 6 and 12 letters long containing either “cat”, “dog” or
“mouse”? A
(?=\b\w{6,12}\b)\w*(cat|dog|mouse)\w*

Continuing at The End of The Previous Match \G
Applying «\G\w» to the string “test string” matches „t”. Applying it again matches „e”. The 3rd attempt yields „s” and the 4th attempt matches the second „t” in the string
